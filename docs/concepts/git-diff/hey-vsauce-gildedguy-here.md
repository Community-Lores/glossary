# Hey Vsauce, ~~Michael~~ Gildedguy Here!

_...or you mean, how to not be confused between an Michael Stvens from an Michael Moy?_

## Why this page ever created?

It's actually started as an meme from [Gildedguy's (Michael Moy)](../../lexicons/hyundojo/mikedmoy.md)

This should served as an document for confused Internet users between these two Michaels here (atleast in this case, Vsauce and Gildedguy the animator here, before we start adding more Michaels here)

Canonical URLs for this `git diff` article are:

* `https://glossary.community-lores.tk/git-diff/hey-vsauce-gildedguy-here` - most services block those free domains from Freemon, so you probably use the shortlink below instead
* `https://kutt.it/hey-vsauce-gildedguy-here` - much better, some sites might don't like shortlinks at all
* `https://gitlab.com/Community-Lores/glossary/blob/main/docs/concepts/git-diff/hey-vsauce-gildedguy-here.md` - a lot longer, just in case they're sussing out `kutt.it` links and also optionally replace `gitlab.com` with `github.com` if they also prefer GitHub (at lwast some GitLab-only markup might break)
