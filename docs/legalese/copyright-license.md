## For content reusers

When giving credit tto the work from this project in any format, there are things you need to remember when building:

* URLs should be point to its blob page [in the canonical Git repository][gitlab] (or its GitHub mirror) on the `main` branch.
* If you prefer to point into an specific revision (Git commit), depending on your case:
  * our `kutt.it` links always point to the latest revision, so you need to generate on your own
  * if you gone to use our `glossary.community-lores.tk` (possibly `glossary.lores.community` in the future), add `/?revision=<commit-id>` to the URL, where `<commit-id>` is the latest revision of that content
  * or, if you just use the GitHub/GitLab blob URLs instead, just change `main` to point to specific commit ID instead

Here's an example text generated from [the Chooser beta](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) as an guideline on what the format looks like in HTML format:

```html
 <p xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"><a property="dct:title" rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://gitlab.com/Community-Lores/glossary/blob/main/docs/path/to/article.md"><insert the title of that article> | Community Lores Glossary</a> by <a rel="cc:attributionURL dct:creator" property="cc:attributionName" href="https://glossary.community-lores.tk/contributors">The Pins Team and contributors</a> is licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1" target="_blank" rel="license noopener noreferrer" style="display:inline-block;">CC BY-SA 4.0<img style="height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/cc.svg?ref=chooser-v1"><img style="height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/by.svg?ref=chooser-v1"><img style="height:22px!important;margin-left:3px;vertical-align:text-bottom;" src="https://mirrors.creativecommons.org/presskit/icons/sa.svg?ref=chooser-v1"></a></p> 
```

...and in pure Markdown:

```md

### Finding article titles in content

![Article title highlighted by an contributor as guide](https://community-lores.gitlab.io/glossary/img/finding-article-article-screenshot.png)

For most cases, the title you should use is the H1 text you first see after those file options buttons in GitLab file blob UI. Don't include any text that's has strikethrough formatting on it.

When in doubt, ask the maintainers or any of the article contributors for help on determining the article title.

### Additional Credits may Required

The Creative Commons license we use only applies to plain-text contents from this repo, within the `docs` directory. Any media or other contents used in this

[gitlab]: https://gitlab.com/Community-Lores/glossary

## Reporting license misuse

If you found an content reuser desn't follow the conditions of the CC BY-SA 4.0 International, such as:

* not giving credit when due
* making derivatives in another license, without written permission approved by an project maintainer
* if making derivatives, missing notices that changes are diverted from the upstream

...then please let them know so they can fix it quickly. When you approaching the maintainers regarding that, we'll try our best not to reach the problem to courts (because it's costly for both sides).

## For fork maintainers
