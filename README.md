# Glossary for Community Lores and other apps

> **:warning: This README and other stuff in this repository is still work-in-progress, proceed at your own risk.**

This repository is where we write what an word mean, its usages and policies when using it within both internal team communications and
in public community places. This is also where our apps and our editorial team at Recap Time redirect you if you still confused between [these two Linuses][git-diff-lttstore]
(or worst, between [two Michaels][hey-vsauce-gildedguy-here] (or [more if you want][so-many-michaels-here])), as of course, where the community can drop
their glossaries from their community wikis for the Community Lores project.

## Contributing and Code of Conduct
